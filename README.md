HiPACE++ is an open-source portable GPU-capable quasi-static particle-in-cell code for wakefield acceleration written in C++.
It is a full re-writing of the legacy code [HiPACE](http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0741-3335/56/8/084012), the Highly efficient Plasma ACcelerator Emulator.
Its main features are:
 - Multiple beam and plasma species to simulation beam-driven wakefield acceleration
 - A laser envelope solver to simulate laser-driven wakefield acceleration
 - An advanced [explicit field solver](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevAccelBeams.25.104603) for increased accuracy
 - Diagnostics compliant with the [openPMD standard](https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-standard)
 - Arbitrary profiles for the beams and plasma profiles
 - Readers from files for the beam and laser profiles
 - Adaptive time step and sub-cycling
 - Additional physics (field ionization, binary collisions, temperature effects, radiation reactions)

HiPACE++ is built on the [AMReX](https://amrex-codes.github.io) library, which provides for particle and field data structures.
